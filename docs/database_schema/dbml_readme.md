### How to Visualize the Database Schema

This directory contains a .dsl file which uses Database Markup Language (DBML) to describe the structure of an application's database.

To visualize this schema as an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):

1.  **Copy the Code:** Open the file and copy its entire contents.
2.  **Go to dbdiagram.io:** Open your web browser and navigate to [https://dbdiagram.io/home](https://dbdiagram.io/home).
3.  **Paste the Code:** In the editor panel on the left side of the dbdiagram.io site, delete any existing sample code and paste the DBML code you copied from the `.dsl` file.
4.  **View the Diagram:** The database diagram should be automatically generated and to appear in the right panel.

You can use this tool to view relationships between tables, understand data types, and grasp the overall database structure.

For more information on the DBML syntax used in the `.dsl` file, refer to the official documentation: [https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/docs/](https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/docs/)
